    "You can use the __MLA-NLP-DAY1-LOGISTIC-REGR-NB__ notebook as yor starting code. Train and test your model with the corresponding datasets provided here. We are using F1 score to rank submissions. Sklearn provides the [__f1_score():__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html) function if you want to see how your model works on your training or validation set.\n",
